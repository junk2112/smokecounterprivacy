        The App does not collect or store any personal data, including names, email addresses, or usage data. Any data entered

    </p>
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, it is used solely for the purpose of providing app functionality. 
        We do not transmit or process your data externally.

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

        The App does not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is securely stored on your device. It is not accessible to us or any third parties. We recommend keeping your 
        device secure and using a strong password.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        As the App does not collect personal data, there are no specific rights regarding data access or deletion. However, you 
        may uninstall the App at any time, which will remove all associated data stored on your device.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
